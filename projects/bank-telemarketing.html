    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project applies statistical learning and machine learning techniques to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, using data from a real-world bank marketing campaign. The dataset includes a variety of client attributes, contact details, and campaign-related variables.

        By building and evaluating classification models, this project aims to support data-driven decision-making in marketing strategy. The insights and models developed here can be applied across industries such as banking, business analytics, and finance to improve customer targeting and campaign effectiveness.

    <h2> Answering Business Intelligence Questions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>would be the cost of misclassifying a client's response </li>
    <p>The repercussion of misclassifying a client would be the wasted time and effort to contact the client.</p>

    <li>What are some aspects of this bank campaign that the bank could improve on?</li>
    <p>The analysis revealed that the bank didn't have a strong relationship with the clients based on the missing data and data from previous contacts. The bank can work on establishing a stronger relationship with the clientele. In this way, the bank can begin developing trust from their clients and in term the clients might be more willing to subscribe to the term deposit with the bank.</p>

    <li>What are some variables that were particularly important for predicting responses?</li>
    <p> The analysis revealed that duration of the phone calls were the most important variable for predicting responses. The bank could focus on getting the clients to stay longer on the calls. This would give the agents more time to advertise the term deposit to the client.</p>

    <li>Who is in our main demographic?</li>
    <p>According to the analysis results, a typical client for this bank would be between 30 to 40 years old and working in management or blue-collar. With this information, the bank can come up with some incentives to subscribing for that type of demographic.</p>
    </ol>
